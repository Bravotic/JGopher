# JGopher
A gopher client plus gopher library for Java

JGopher is a very early in development (but still very powerful) gopher client.  The core of the JGopher client is the JGopherView widget for swing.  This widget allows for an easily embedable gopher view into any swing application.  The main focus of this project is on that gopher view widget, with the client being used to show off its power.

### Building

To build, simply run `mvn build` then `mvn package`, the output will be in the target/ folder.  com.bravotic.libjgopher should be easily added into any java project however, even if it uses maven or not.  Binaries of both the client, as well as the libjgopher library will be avaliable as soon as JGopher is in a usable state for everyday gopher browsing.
